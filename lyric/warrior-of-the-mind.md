Have you forgotten the lessons i taught you
[Athena]
Have you forgotten to turn off your heart
This is not you
I see you changing from how I've designed you
have you forgotten your purpose let me remind you
goddess of wisdom
master of war
My life has one mission
Create the greatest warrior
I had a challenge a test of skill
a magic boar only the best would kill
one day a boy came for the thrill
a boy whose own mind rivalled the boar's own will
lest go
maybe one day hell follow me
and we'll make a greater tomorrow
then they'll see
i know hell change the world cause 
he is the warrior of the might

maybe one day i'll reach him
and we cant build his skill
he is the warrior of the might

show yourself
i know youre watching me
show yourself
i can see you
how can you see through my speell
haha i was llying and you fell for my bluff
well done you lie to me 
you first and maybe I'll do the same
you are athena 
sounds like a plan bestest of friend
